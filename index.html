                                Caisa is the smallest of the cats, but the one
                                everyone respect the most. But with that said,
                                she is no troublemake. She prefers to keep an
                                eye on the other cats' quarrels at a safe
                                distance. Caisa is headstrong and knows what she
                                wants; food, a cosy hiding place and
                                affirmations. When she wants to cuddle, you
                                better start cuddling.
